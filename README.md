   Developed an AI-driven platform to personalize career pathways by analyzing data to recommend Udemy courses and LinkedIn job opportunities based on user skill gaps. The platform 
   was built using ReactJS, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL, integrating Python, LLM, and APIs from Udemy and LinkedIn. Data was stored in Redis, and the application was deployed on AWS 
   EC2 and S3.

 * Task Management Application:
   I created a drag-and-drop task management application with a smooth user interface designed using React DnD, React.js, and Redux. The design focused on responsive and customizable 
   UI components, using Tailwind and MUI. Secure role-based access was integrated through Firebase Authentication, with the backend powered by Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. The 
   application also leveraged the Azure Translation API for real-time language translation.

 * Healthcare Management Application:
   Built a healthcare management system with a responsive UI using ReactJS, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL. It focused on ensuring HIPAA compliance for managing patient and billing data, 
   utilizing Spring Data JPA for efficient data handling. The deployment pipeline was automated using GitHub Actions, enabling continuous integration and delivery.
